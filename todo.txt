==== BUGS ====

evolution order is async and can be out of order (middle evolution rendering last etc)

==== IDEAS ====

instead of fetching the pokemon in evolution chain (and in future in ability/egg groups),
	we only need the ID, which we can get by finding the indexOf the name in the pokemon list array

==== TODO ====

egg group modals
display for showing all pokemon at once, user can scroll through. pagination?
add page to history.pushState stack for forward/back navigation
show move types, damage, learn method, etc

==== TODO MAYBE ====

split into tabs for basics, damage, evolution, moves, use '#' in url
modal for abilities/egg groups shows all pokemon of that ability/egg group
show how pokemon evolves, or at least lvl/item/other
search pokemon by type/click on types and open modal with those pokemon
simple mode only show stat bars and top info
local storage for previous pokemon name and simple mode setting
night mode, fullscreen, contact btn

==== TODO TECH ====

ditch bootstrap and jquery, use umbrella, lighten page
replace fontawesome with heroicons (search, loader)
make it a pwa? offline cache pokemon on load, btn to clear cache and toggle to not cache pokemon

==== TODO CAN'T ====

missing sword/shield pokemon in pokeapi... also needs meltan, regionals
move-learn-method? goes by gen and API doesn't have gen 8...
show move type next to move preview? needs separate API call for each one...
